# Express Exercise 2



# Part 1 — nodemon Setup

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source code and automatically restart your server. 

Just use ``nodemon`` instead of ``node`` to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. 

1.	Install ``nodemon`` from your terminal with:

	```
	npm install -g nodemon

	```

1.	Run a web app to test it works.  For example:

	```
	nodemon index.js

	```

	Try changing your source code in ``index.js`` and your server should automatically restart.


# Part 2 — PostMan Setup


1.	Install the ``postman`` Chrome extension

1.	Run it and test it works with a ``GET`` request
